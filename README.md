# GET Some Gifts!

Let's GET some gifts for the frontend team! We'll want to keep track of what each instructor wants, and be able to see the total amount we need to spend. 

You'll be working to finish a partially complete application. The HTML and CSS has been built out for you. You'll need to make a GET request to display two sections of information: 
* As a user, I should be able to see a list of all receipients with their wanted gift item and price. 
* As a user, I should be able to see the total amount I need to spend if I purchased all gifts. 

_Note: You'll need to use clone down this [Holiday Shopping API Repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/holiday-shopping-api) to complete your tasks. Don't worry about any of the POSTing information, you'll get to that during a later Advent date!_
