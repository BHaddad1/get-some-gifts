# GET Some Gifts!

Let's GET some gifts for the frontend team! We'll want to keep track of what each instructor wants, and be able to see the total amount we need to spend. 

You'll be working to finish a partially complete application. The HTML and CSS has been built out for you. You'll need to make a GET request to display the following: 
* As a user, I should be able to see a list of all receipients with their wanted gift item and price. 
* As a user, I should be able to see the total amount I need to spend if I purchased all gifts. 
* BONUS: As a user, when I check "purchased" for each item, I should see my total cost decrease accordingly.

_Note: You'll need to use this [Holiday Shopping API](https://mysterious-mesa-00016.herokuapp.com/items) to complete your tasks._
